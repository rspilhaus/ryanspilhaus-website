			<p class="work-intro-text-summary">Rebuilding the MBB+ website was one of the most satisfying projects I&rsquo;ve been able to work on at MBB+. After poking at and analyzing our current website for the better part of a year, we decided it was time for a re-build. Armed with a fresh new set of designs, I set about creating a fantastic example of what good front-end development and WordPress integration can accomplish.</p>

			<h3 class="work-row-half-title">Front-End Development</h3>
			<p class="work-row-half-content">Built using modern best-practices and optimization techniques, I coded the front-end of the site with several goals in mind. The first goal was to faithfully replicate the designer&rsquo;s vision. Once that was accomplished, I optimized for speed, responsiveness across screen sizes, cross-browser compatibility, and a smooth user experience through transitional interfaces. Finally, since I knew I would be integrating it with WordPress, I made sure that the code was perfectly aligned with a WordPress CMS integration.</p>

			<p class="work-row-half-content">I love working with WordPress, and this project really allowed me to show off what the platform is capable of as an organization&rsquo;s CMS. Creating the theme from scratch, I customized the WordPress admin to allow for multiple different content types, custom editable content sections on each page and easy to use settings. Utilizing proper WordPress conventions I was able to create a well-running, efficient, and easy-to-use CMS to administer the site.</p>
