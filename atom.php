			<p class="work-row-half-content">We didn’t want there to be anything that would cause friction for the visitor signing the petition, so it was imperative that the site work on mobile devices. The ultimate goal was to make it as quick and easy as possible to sign the petition. Things like Facebook sign in and a responsive design helped make this possible.</p>
