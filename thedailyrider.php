			<p class="work-row-half-content">I did the Front-End and WordPress development for this site, working with a designer to make sure that the code matched up with the vision for the site. It was important that everything work responsively, because the client identified their audience as on-the-go. I also made sure that the client was able to edit their site easily, customizing the WordPress admin to allow them to easily add products and adjust information.</p>
