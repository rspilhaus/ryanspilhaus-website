In order to create emails that look great on any device and on any platform though, you need an expert. I&rsquo;m well acquainted with the black arts of email design and development, and I&rsquo;m living on the cutting edge of the email&nbsp;revolution. </p>

			<h3 class="work-row-half-title">Responsive Email Design</h3>
			<p class="work-row-half-content">Email design is not like web design. There are many more constraints to take into account, and often if a designer doesn't understand those constraints, it can mean extra work for the developer as well as missed deadlines and blown budgets. In addition to the inherent complexity of building emails, it’s now more important than ever that emails look good on people’s phones and tablets. I have extensive experience creating responsive emails, and know which clients will be able to utilize them and which&nbsp;won't.</p>

			<h3 class="work-row-half-title">Email Development</h3>
			<p class="work-row-half-content">Email development requires a very particular skill set. Since there are literally dozens of different email clients, devices, and operating systems that your email may be viewed on, it requires an obsessive level of attention to detail and an intimate knowledge of email coding best-practices. I pride myself on developing emails that don't just look great in one client, but look great in all email clients. I understand the quirks behind different email clients and devices, I am able to address those and build an email that looks beautiful no matter how the recipient views&nbsp;it.</p>
