			<p class="work-row-half-content">FCCPT had a lot of information that needed to be organized and presented in a clear way. One of the challenges with large sites like this is always navigation - I came up with a solution for navigation that helped quickly put the user where they needed to be, and that worked great on any device. In addition to that, I wireframed the rest of the site&rsquo;s layout, including several unique templates and pieces of functionality</p>

			<p class="work-row-half-content">After a designer had created a design based off my wireframes, I developed the front-end markup for the site. I added a lot of small touches to things like hero and UI animations to give it a polished and clever feel.</p>
