			<p class="work-row-half-content">I built a pair of responsive websites that look great on any screen. A great design deserves a great code base, and lots of care was put into the development of these two sites. A non-profit can&rsquo;t afford to have their message hindered by a buggy&nbsp;site!</p>

			<h3 class="work-row-half-title">WordPress Development</h3>
			<p class="work-row-half-content">I build all my WordPress themes from scratch, because it allows me to have complete control over the code. This is important when the build requires extensive customization, as this one did. In addition to integrating WordPress as the CMS, I built out special functionality within WordPress for things like events management, feature management, custom authorship and multiple custom post&nbsp;types.</p>
