			<h3 class="work-row-half-title">HTML/CSS X-Men</h3>
			<p class="work-row-half-content">After seeing Logan I was really excited about the X-men and decided to show it by creating a set of animated characters built completely with HTML and CSS. Anyhow, people seemed to really like it &ndash; it has over 80,000 views and it was featured in places like the <a href="http://codepen.io/spark/15" target="_blank">CodePen Spark</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/841295479778492416" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine&rsquo;s Twitter</a> and <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/collective/collective-295/" target="_blank">Codrops</a>. These were made with only HTML and CSS - no images or Javascript necessary!</p>

			<p class="work-row-half-content">After moving to Kansas City I fell in love with the city&rsquo;s signature cuisine - BBQ. To better express that love, I created a guide to the city&rsquo;s BBQ style, history and restaurants.</p>

			<h3 class="work-row-half-title">Counterwatch</h3>
			<p class="work-row-half-content">I&rsquo;m mildly addicted to the video game Overwatch, so it was only natural that I&rsquo;d want to build something Overwatch-related. Counterwatch is a little site that lets you determine which of the 24 heroes you should play based on what the opponent&rsquo;s team is.  </p>

			<p class="work-row-half-content">I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed playing around with animation over the past year or so. In this tiny project, I used <a href="https://greensock.com/gsap" target="_blank">GSAP</a> to animate the stars, planets and rocket. I created the planets and rocket in Illustrator and embedded them as SVGs.</p>
